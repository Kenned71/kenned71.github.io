											<h1>A Night at the Arcade<br />
											</h1>
										</header>
										<p>	I’d finally turned twenty-one years old.  A huge new milestone in a young man or lady’s life.  For what reason?  As far as I can tell, all the main reasons people celebrate turning 21 are also deemed negative traits by society.  Now I can drink my sorrows away and gamble my wallet away at a casino, what a thrill!  My buzzkill personality aside, I’d turned twenty-one years old, and boy had it been an uneventful night.  School tends to keep one busy, and it’s hardly a good idea to risk a hangover when you’ve got eight-thirty classes the next day.  So my roommate and I ate at a ramen restaurant and called it a night there.  It was a good night, but it was hardly enough to constitute the regular crazy bash for a twenty-first.  Tonight, we were going to fix that, and celebrate it properly. </p>
                                        <p>My brother, sister, and I got out of the car, entering the brisk cold evening awaiting us.  The cold air passed through our chattering teeth.  I’m certainly glad we didn’t have park too far from the building.  We walked in, and I took in the surroundings.  The first thing that greeted me was the bar, with the tallest chalkboard I’ve ever seen on the wall.  To my direct left, there were pinball machines reaching to the leftmost wall of the barcade, with tables branded from the wild west to alien attacks to Godzilla.  Two rows of back-to-back arcade machines lie behind them, them, with dozens of games I’d never gotten the chance to play before, not to mention quite a few I’d never even heard of before.  Walking through, I saw in the very back, there was a lounge section with 4 televisions, hooked up to emulators for classic systems such as the Nintendo Entertainment System and the SEGA Genesis, with ROMs for any game on the system from A to Z.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>I’m generally not all too knowledgeable about alcohol given my usual aversion.  I skimmed over the menu of mixed drinks.  I think those are supposed to hide the taste of alcohol.  The only positive experiences I’d ever remembered with alcohol were with the fruit-heavy stuff when I could hardly taste it.  On the menu, a bunch of anime and video game references lie within every drink’s name, reaching from Dragon Ball Super with the “Goku Black Rose” to My Hero Academia with “The Midoriya.”  Well, a Goku Black Rose it is, I suppose.  I chuckled to myself as the bartender prepared it for me.  He’d technically gotten the name wrong, as I knew as a Dragon Ball fan, that the “e” in Rose was very pronounced, with the spelling of Rosé staying closer to the intended pronunciation.  I laughed to myself not because of the bartender’s mistake, but because I was such a nitpick to even notice or care about it.  I really am such a nerd.  Then again, I am celebrating my twenty-first birthday by playing a bunch of video games, so I guess that much should have been obvious before I even walked through the door. </p>
                                        <p>The drink itself was a light almost translucent red, and I almost asked myself if I’d just been poured a glass of cough syrup passed off as alcohol.  I took my first sip of the night and it flowed over my tongue, eradicating what was left of the reheated turkey and stuffing I ate with my family about an hour or so ago.  I wasn’t anxious to wash the taste away, but I didn’t care too much.  Thanksgiving meals are always best on Thanksgiving itself.  Microwave ovens can’t really do justice to a table overflowing with lively people and hot freshly cooked dishes.  This cough syrup Rose wasn’t too bad though.  I wish I could say the taste doesn’t remind me of cough syrup, but I don’t think that’d be true.  I certainly couldn’t drink it for more than a few sips at a time, but I can’t say it was a bad drink.  Probably for the best not to drink too much on my first real alcoholic expedition anyways. </p>
                                        <p>  The rest of the night was a breeze.  I was amazed when I saw the machine for Marvel VS Capcom 2.  I’d never gotten a chance to play the game before and it certainly exceeded my expectations.  For the longest time I was the unrivalled champion between myself and my siblings, with a team of Magneto, Thanos, and Mega Man.  In my matches between them, I even reached the top of the in-game leaderboard with 10 consecutive wins.  After switching up my team, beating my team seemed to be an impossible feat, given the strength of my new favorite character, the seemingly invincible mutant killer, the Sentinel.  That was, until my brother figured out where Sentinel was on the roster and learned his fighting style.  After nearly 18 consecutive victories, my glorious winstreak had finally been brought to a halt by my brother with the very character I’d begun depending on for my victories.  At the end of the night, I simply had to admit defeat to his skills, and we shook on a good game together.  I only had the one drink that night.  I think that was all I really needed.
